Does it render?
===============

Test if a tag is supported by default OSM rendering.

Semi-automatic extraction of tags from the xml stylesheet generated from [OpenStreetMap Carto](https://github.com/gravitystorm/openstreetmap-carto).

Tags are listed in taglist.md in alphabetical order (keys are sections). From this file the json renders/mapnikcarto.js it's generated.
